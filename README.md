# Supervised machine learning for Space Antenna Performance Prediction (ssapp)
### By Niels Skovgaard Jensen
This repository is an overview of the work conducted as my master thesis at The Technical University of Denmark in collaboration with TICRA FOND. 

The main objective is to create surrogate models of antennas from data created by fine antennas models. Here TICRAS Toolset has been used for generating far field antenna patterns of different antenna configurations which are then modelled by a set of different machine learning methods.
