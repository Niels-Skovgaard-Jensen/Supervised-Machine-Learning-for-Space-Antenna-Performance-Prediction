# Supervised machine learning for Space Antenna Performance Prediction (ssapp)
### By Niels Skovgaard Jensen
This repository is an overview of the work conducted as my Master Thesis at The Technical University of Denmark in collaboration with TICRA FOND. 

The main objective is to create surrogate models of antennas from data created by fine antennas models. Here TICRAS Toolset has been used for generating far field antenna patterns of different antenna configurations which are then modelled by a set of different machine learning methods.

For overview and mathy stuff look [here](https://skoogydan.github.io/Supervised-Machine-Learning-for-Space-Antenna-Performance-Prediction/)


The project is structured roughly in accordance with the [cookiecutter data science template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).

ssapp - main packaged code for models data tranformations and so on

notebooks - Jupyter notebooks for quick tests and exploration of data



Easiest way to install is simply to make a new virtual enviornment and run
"""
python setup.py install
"""
